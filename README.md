**DATA Description**

DC crime incident locations. The dataset contains a subset of locations and attributes of incidents reported in the ASAP (Analytical Services Application) crime report database by the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). I extracted incident reported from 2010/1/1 to 2020/06/19. Here I listed attribute used for visualization and analysis.
